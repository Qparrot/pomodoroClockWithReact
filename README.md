# FreeCodeCamp Project: Pomodoro Clock with React
**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/XpKrrW.

## Difficulties
1. Use one click handler to add or reduce the duration of the break/session. -> divset attribute.
2. Don't pass the param in the onclick={this.props.clickHandler}. Pass it via the event.currentTarget.value.
3. Manage the time to show the alarm.
